# Intro
* In the 1760s, Americans loved the British, **would shift towards revolution**
* The revolution solidified American identity with new ideals sparking a global "age of revolution"
# The Origins of the American Revolution
### Context In Britain
* No agreed upon relationship between Britain and colonists
* Old Whigs
	* Conquer territory, extract resources
	* Raise taxes and cut spending on colonies
	* Authoritarian
* Radical Whigs
	* Trade and manufacturing
	* Economic growth will pay for debt
	* Colonies should have equal status
### Politics in the Colonies
* Colonies were distinct politically, formed assemblies
* Had higher participation because land was more accessible
* Political thought drew from the country party of Britain, believed in corruption of power
#### Authority
* The **Enlightenment** and the **Great Awakening** both led to a challenging of authority
* Locke and Whitefield both contributed to a growing anti-establishment ideology
* Culturally, in the 18th century Americans wanted to mimic Britons through **Anglicization,** bought British luxuries
# The Causes of the American Revolution
## Intro
* Seven Years' War -> Taxes
* British debt doubled, 13.5 times its yearly revenue
* King George III Took power in 1760, brought Tories in, replacing Whigs, authoritarian vision
## Not Cool
### 1763
* Royal Proclamation of 1763 - no expansion
### 1764
* Sugar Act - increased enforcement of molasses smuggling, tried by vice-admiralty courts not juries
* Currency Act - No paper money
### 1765
* Stamp Act, **first direct tax**
	* Affected everyone, not just merchants like Sugar Act
## Resistance
* Three forms based on class
	* Legislative - elites
		* Virginia Resolves, declared colonists had same privileges as British citizens
		* Stamp Act Congress - nine colonies sent delegates in 1765, issued a "Declaration of Rights and Grievances"
			* Trial by jury
			* Taxed only by elected representatives
	* Economic - Merchants
		* Non-importation
	* Protest - Commoners
		* Burned effigy of stamp distributor Andrew Oliver
		* Destroyed house of Thomas Hutchinson
## Compromise
* November 16 1765, all twelve stamp distributors resigned, by 1766 Sons of Liberty in most colonies

* **Colonists still liked Britain,** in NYC large statue made of King George to celebrate repeal
## New Taxes
* June 1767 - Townshend Acts were passed
	* taxes on lead, glass, paint, tea
	* Revenue from seizures went to officers and royal officials, incentivizing convictions
## Resistance 2
* Nonimportation again

* **More inclusive and coordinated, helped build American unity**
## Compromise 2
* March 1770, everything repealed except tea, mainly to save face
