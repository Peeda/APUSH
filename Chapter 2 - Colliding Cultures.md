# Spain's Rivals Emerge
## Intro
* While Spain was plundering, the Reformation was pretty bad for England and France back in Europe
* Spain's rivals had moral justification due to human rights, also religion
## The French
* Began early 16th century

		* There established New Netherland
		* Was a launching pad for its colonies in Caribbean and Africa
* Not a fan of Spain, wanted to be less bad to natives
	* Purchased land
	* Like the French, interested in **profit not conquest**, mainly traded
* Traded wampum to get beaver pelts
* In addition to trade, had farms, settlements, lumber camps through **patroon system**
	* Granted large estates to landlords who paid passage for workers
* Labor shortages, patroon system sucks, imported 11 slaves in 1626 to build New Amsterdam (modern NYC)
* Imported slave women, had kids, by 1660 New Amsterdam had largest enslaved population
	* Less exploitative than later America though
	* Sue for wages
	* Could get "half freedom," work their own land just with a tax to owners
* Got progressively worse as economic goals crowded out moral questions
## The Portuguese
* Were leaders well ahead of Columbus's voyage
* Spanish profits accelerated efforts, more rivalry
* Pope intervened with Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494

* "Sea Dogges" plundered Spanish ships and towns
* Spain got mad, 1588 King Phillip II launched largest invasion in history to destroy British navy, depose Elizabeth
* England was doing alright, forced Spanish to flee for reinforcements, however a big storm called the "Protestant wind" anihilated the ships
	* Saved England, secured Protestantism, opened seas for English expansion
* By 1600s, they were ready.
* Elizabeth died in 1603 before colonization, King James is in
* 1604 made peace with Spain, no more piracy
# Jamestown
* 1607 three ships, the **Susan Constant, the Godspeed, and the Discovery** sailed 
* Found land upriver, no Spaniards, no Natives
* Found out land was ignored because the soil was bad, brackish water caused disease
* Built Jamestown there anyway, amid the Powhatan Confederacy
* Gentlemen didn't want to work
* Powhatan saved them first winter, trading and providing since they were doing pretty well
## Starving Time
* Winter 1609-1610, supplies lost at sea, relations with Natives went down

* Puritans came in families unlike Virginia, and were generally equivalent to the middle class
## General Information

	* Survivors say English as potential allies against rival tribes 
* Population grew unlike in Virginia where it went down
