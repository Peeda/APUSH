# Introduction
* Native Americans were quite advanced before European arrival
	* Built settled communities
	* Seasonal migration patterns
	* maintained peace,
	* trade

# The First Americans
## Intro
* Native Americans had varying creation stories

	* They were **diverse,** remember that.
### Agriculture

	* Same time in both the eastern hemisphere and the western hemisphere
* Mexico and Central America - maize around 1200 BCE
* Between Mississippi River and Atlantic - three sisters
	* Corn, beans, squash
* Analysis of remains finds agricultural transition caused **weaker bones and teeth**
	* Despite this it was still good on balance

* Population grew 500 percent in one generation
	* New groups were absorbed into the city
##### Collapse
* By 1300, a series of strains led to collapse

# European Expansion
## Intro
* Before Columbus, Scandinavian seafarers reached America
* Around 1000, Leif Erikson reached Newfoundland, created colony
	* Colony failed due to limited resources, bad weather, food shortages, and Native resistance
## Pre Columbus
* Centuries before Columbus, Crusades linked Europe with Asia
	* Sparked the Renaissance, fueled European expansions
* Asian goods flooded European markets
* **Europeans battled for trade supremacy**
* Spain and Portugal paid middlemen due to location
	* Henry the Navigator innovated
		* 15th century, astrolabe to calculate latitude
		* Caravel, ship suited for exploration
* Portugal made some trading posts in Africa to reach India
	* Limited technology forced sailors to go west into open sea before going east back to Africa
	* Spanish and Portuguese found the Azores, Canary Islands, and Cape Verde Islands
		* These islands were *training grounds* for American colonization
		* First large scale cultivation of sugar by slaves
### Atlantic Islands
* Sugar was widely profitable, consumed by European nobility
* Difficult crop, needed tropical temperatures, daily rainfall, unique soil, 14 months to grow
* The Atlantic islands were good for sugar
* **Guanches,** natives of the Canary Islands, were enslaved or perished soon after arrival
* Portuguese traded guns, iron, and manufactured goods for African war captives
* Plantations on Madeira, Canary Islands, Cape Verde Islands
* Few decades later, Sao Tome became model for plantation system
## Columbus
* While Portugal gained control over African trading networks, Spain wanted its own path to empire
* People knew the Earth was round, Columbus was unique in that he underestimated the size by two thirds
#### The First Trip
* October 12, 1492, landed in the Bahamas and met the native Arawaks, or Taino
* Columbus described them as innocent
	* “They are very gentle and without knowledge of what is evil; nor the sins of murder or theft,” he reported to the Spanish crown. “Your highness may believe that in all the world there can be no better people. . . . They love their neighbors as themselves, and their speech is the sweetest and gentlest in the world, and always with a smile.”
* Columbus found little wealth, however was convinced that there was gold because the Arawaks wore small ornaments of gold
* Left 39 Spaniards while he returned to Spain with 12 captured people
#### The Second Trip
* Seventeen ships, over one thousand men
* After enslaved natives exhausted meager gold reserves, were forced to labor on estates called **encomiendas**
* Bartolome de Las Casas was NOT a fan.
	* “I saw with these Eyes of mine the Spaniards for no other reason, but only to gratify their bloody mindedness, cut off the Hands, Noses, and Ears, both of Indians and Indianesses.”
	* “Who in future generations will believe this?” Las Casas wondered. “I myself writing it as a knowledgeable eyewitness can hardly believe it.”
# Spanish Exploration and Conquest
## Intro
* Spain wanted more stuff
* Managed labor relations through the [[encomienda]]
	* Exploitive feudal arrangement through which Indigenous laborers were tied to vast estates
	* Crown granted a person land and a specified number of natives
	* After de las cases published ""The Destruction of the Indies"" the [[encomienda]] was abolished and replaced with the repartimiento
		* Although milder, still repeated many of the bad parts
## Civilizations
* As they expanded, the Spanish found massive empires that dwarfed those of North America
### Mayans
* Mayan civilization in central America
	* Massive temples
	* Large populations
	* Written Language, math, calendars
	* Unfortunately collapsed before European arrival
		* Likely because of droughts and unsustainable agriculture
	* The most powerful Native civilization would rise after the Mayans, the Aztecs
### Aztecs
* Located in the Valley of Mexico
* Capital Tenochtitlan, founded 1325
* chinampas for farming, fed most of the city
* Templo Mayor, massive pyramid temple at center
* 70,000 people, 200,000 - 250,000 people, all built on a lake
* **Hernan Cortes organized an invasion in 1519**
* Through political divisions, enlisted aid of Native allies, 
* Nearby kingdoms helped, Tarascans to the north and remains of Mayan city states
#### The Invasion
* Entered Tenochtitlan peacefully, then captured emperor Montezuma
* Used him, gained control of gold, silver, and network of mines
* Eventually people revolted, called emperor a traitor
* In **la noche triste,** "the night of sorrows," Montezuma was killed along with a third of the Spanish
* Spanish fled, regrouped, enlisted more allies, and in 1521 besieged the city
* The 85 day siege cut off food and water
* Temples plundered, 15,000 died
### Incas
* Farther south along Andes Mountains in South America
* Capital Cuzco in the Andean highlands
* Stretched form Ecuador to Chile and Argentina
* By 1400, **had thousands of miles of road** typing perhaps 12 million people
* Smallpox hit in 1525, halving population
	* Killed emperor Huayna Capac and some of his family
* War of succession ensued
* Inspired by Cortes, Francisco Pizarro, with 168 men, deceived Incan rulers, and seized the capital in 1533
* Disease, conquest, and slavery ravaged the remnants
## Post Conquest
* Indigenous laborers extracted gold and silver, were transported across the Atlantic in galleons
* Spanish migrants poured in, 225,000 in the 16th century and 750,000 during the entire period of rule (300 years)
* Natives still outnumbered the Spanish, and therefore Spanish were forced to incorporate them into society somewhat
* Mid 1600s, racial hierarchy based on "purity of blood"
	* Peninsulares, Iberian born people occupied the highest power, most land
	* Criollos were next under, rivaled Peninsulares
	* Mestizos, meaning mixed heritage followed
* Interracial marriage was fine, due to lack of women
* By 1600 mestizos were majority
* System was often gamed, Mestizo mothers could insist their daughters were **castizas** meaning quarter native, who would produce pure criollo children under law
* Hybrid culture followed, neither fully Spanish nor indigenous
* Built Mexico City atop Tenochtitlan
### Later Expansion
* Expanded northward from Mexico
* Juan Ponce de Leon landed in Florida 1513
* Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca joined the Narvaez expedition a decade later, shipwrecker
* Pedro Menedez de Aviles founded St. Augustine, Florida in 1565, oldest European settlement in the United States
* Francisco Vazquez de Coronado in the Southwest
* Hernando de Soto in the Southeast
