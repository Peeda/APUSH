# Slavery and the Making of Race
## Slavery
* 1706, Francis Le Jau says slavery is pretty bad in the colonies
* 1660s marked turning point, laws legalized lifetime slavery of Africans
	* Prior to this, no direct classifications of racial preference
* 17th century wars allowed English to capture and enslave Native Americans
	* Pequot War, Massachusetts Bay sold Natives into slavery in West Indies
	* Governor Kieft's War (1641 - 1645) and the two Esopus Wars(1659-1663) Dutch sold natives to Bermuda and Curacao
* Estimated 24,000-51,000 Natives forced into slavery from 1670-1715
## Middle Passage
* Natives kept dying, really bad slaves so Americans turned to Africans
* Transported millions of Africans across ocean in journey called **Middle Passage**
	* Fearsome crew
	* Filth and gloom of the hold
	* Inadequate provisions for captives
	* Desperation
	* Some slaves committed suicide
	* Dysentery left captives lying in pools of poopoo
	* Lost so much skin and flesh from chafing against metal and timber, bones protruded
	* Rapes, whippings, smallpox, conjunctivitis
* Middle Passage had multiple meanings
	* For captains and crews, was one leg in trade of sugar and other goods
	* For slaves, was the middle of three journeys from Africa to America
## Development of Slavery
* European slaves started 1440s, Portuguese sailors wanted gold and spices
* 1440s, Africans used primarily as servants as peasants did agriculture
* American colonization brought abundance of land and scarcity of labor
* Charleston South Carolina founded in 1670 was main entry point for slave trade
	* Spanish 1693, Decree of Sanctuary, allowed freedom for slaves if they converted to Catholicism and swore loyalty to Spain
	* Shows **different conceptions of race** among English and Spanish
* 450,000 Africans in British colonies, out of 11 to 12 million in total
	* More proportion of women, and more children per woman
	* 1662 Virginia law stated slave children inherited condition of mother
* Notions of race were socially construcucted with the rise of slavery, African trader's didn't really view it as selling their own people because skin didn't matter
* Distinction between indentured servants and slaves initially unclear, until 1643 law in Virginia making African women "tithable"
	* Associated their work with difficult agricultural labor, distinguised from white women
