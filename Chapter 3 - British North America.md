# Introduction
* Into 17th and 18th centuries, racial categories solidified, slavery increasingly prominent
* Events in Britain influenced America, colonies matured
# Slavery and the Making of Race
## Slavery
* 1706, Francis Le Jau says slavery is pretty bad in the colonies
* 1660s marked turning point, laws legalized lifetime slavery of Africans
	* Prior to this, no direct classifications of racial preference
* 17th century wars allowed English to capture and enslave Native Americans
	* Pequot War, Massachusetts Bay sold Natives into slavery in West Indies
	* Governor Kieft's War (1641 - 1645) and the two Esopus Wars(1659-1663) Dutch sold natives to Bermuda and Curacao
* Estimated 24,000-51,000 Natives forced into slavery from 1670-1715
## Middle Passage
* Natives kept dying, really bad slaves so Americans turned to Africans
* Transported millions of Africans across ocean in journey called **Middle Passage**
	* Fearsome crew
	* Filth and gloom of the hold
	* Inadequate provisions for captives
	* Desperation
	* Some slaves committed suicide
	* Dysentery left captives lying in pools of poopoo
	* Lost so much skin and flesh from chafing against metal and timber, bones protruded
	* Rapes, whippings, smallpox, conjunctivitis
* Middle Passage had multiple meanings
	* For captains and crews, was one leg in trade of sugar and other goods
	* For slaves, was the middle of three journeys from Africa to America
## Development of Slavery
* European slaves started 1440s, Portuguese sailors wanted gold and spices
* 1440s, Africans used primarily as servants as peasants did agriculture
* American colonization brought abundance of land and scarcity of labor
* Charleston South Carolina founded in 1670 was main entry point for slave trade
	* Spanish 1693, Decree of Sanctuary, allowed freedom for slaves if they converted to Catholicism and swore loyalty to Spain
	* Shows **different conceptions of race** among English and Spanish
* 450,000 Africans in British colonies, out of 11 to 12 million in total
	* More proportion of women, and more children per woman
	* 1662 Virginia law stated slave children inherited condition of mother
* Notions of race were socially constructed with the rise of slavery, African trader's didn't really view it as selling their own people because skin didn't matter
* Distinction between indentured servants and slaves initially unclear, until 1643 law in Virginia making African women "tithable"
	* Associated their work with difficult agricultural labor, distinguished from white women
# Turmoil in Britain
## Intro
* Religous conflict 16th century England, Catholic and Protestant monarchs fighting

* 1640 Parliament refused subsidies to suppress rebellion in Scotland
* Rebellion in Ireland 1641, by 1642 strained relations caused civil war in England
* 1649 Charles I executed, Oliver Cromwell
## Impact of War in the Colonies
* English civil war forced colonies to take a stand
	* Old colonies, like Virginia + Maryland tended to the crown, newer colonies like Massachusetts tended parliament
	* During war all colonies were neutral, to avoid war, execution of Charles forced them to take a stand
	* Some stood with dead King's son, so parliament enforced an embargo on the 6 rebelling colonies, which included Virginia and Barbados
	* **Navigation Act of 1651** compelled merchants to ship goods to England
## The Glorious Revolution
* Monarchy was restored with Charles the II, but he was kinda catholic and pro-French, considered very cringe

	* Bishops and Parliamentarians offered throne to Prince William of Holland and his English wife Mary, daughter of the king
	* Peaceful coup, dubbed the **Glorious Revolution**
## The Colonies
* Prior to the Glorious Revolution, conflict in the colonies reflected the conflict in Europe
* 70s and 80s, Charles II tightened control, new acts and councils
* This and threats from NA and French believed colonists to think the Catholics and NA wanted to destroy colonies
* Fears were reinforced by **King Phillip** or **Wampanoag leader Metacom's** rebellion in 1675
* James II created the **Dominion of New England** in 1686
	* Consolidated New England colonies into one entity
	* Colonist's didn't like loss of individuality
	* **Sir Edmund Andros** the dominion's governor also forced military service against Maine Indians in 1687
* 1688 invasion by William of Orange made James II flee to France
## Revolt
* Provincial leader tried to hide the rise of William and Mary
* Massachusetts, New York, Maryland colonists overthrew dominion government, restoring status quo

# Riot, Rebellion, and Revolt
## Intro
* British establishment wasn't peaceful, Pequot War, Mystic massacre, King Phillip's War, Susquehannock War, Bacon's Rebellion, Pueblo Revolt
* Sparknotes summary: so the Puritans liked the Mohegans so they fought the Pequots, then they pissed off the Wampanoags later and fought war, and then the gosh darn Mohegans joined on the side of the Wampanoags! what a day!
## Pequot War
* May 1637, Puritans from Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut marched into NA territory claimed by New England, to attack Pequots
* Lit the town on fire
* Motivated by rivalry between Pequot and Narragansett, and Mohegan who battled for control of fur and wampum,
	* Conflict forced English and Dutch to choose sides
* Victory provided security and stability for English colonies, benefitted Mohegan influence
### Irony
* History repeated when the Mohegan, desperate for more power, joined Wampanoag war against Puritans

### The tide turns
* 1676, colonies got some allies, including some Pequot and Mohegans, to fight
* NA were unable to plant crops, forced to live off land, continued struggle was hard as they were continually pursued
* Caught up with Metacom in 1676, sachem was slain by a Christian Native American
