# Consumption and Trade in the British Atlantic
## Intro
* Transatlantic trade benefitted both sides, created feeling of commonality between colonists and British
* American income rose, people started buying instead of making tools, clothes, or utensils, called the **consumer revolution**
## Currency
* Colonists had no metal for coins when they arrived, only the crown could mint, so used nontraditional currency
	* Wampum
	* nails
	* tobacco
* 1690 Massachusetts started using paper bills
* Issues with counterfeiting and non universality between colonies caused Board of Trade to restrict paper money Currency Acts of 1751 and 1763
## The Caribbean
* Continental colonies were actually **less important** to Britain to sugar-producing islands of Caribbean
* Caribbean colonies traded with continental, because they only had sugarcane
* Traded slaves too
## Parliament Control
* To ensure profits of trade got to Britain, parliament taxed through Navigation Acts
* Prior to 1763, Britain lost more money enforcing the law than they made from taxing
	* Colonists traded with foreign nations, pirates, or smugglers
* Sugar Act in 1764, Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts, parliament taxed stuff
* Patriots stopped importing, reverted to domestic products
## Growth
* The consumer revolution fueled growth of cities
* 1775, biggest ones were Boston, Newport, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston

## South Carolina and Georgia
* Slavery was also central, but local conditions created different system
* Originally banned in Georgia, legal by 1750
* South Carolina was the only colony by 1750 with a majority enslaved population
* Similarly bad slave codes, despite this slaves still had more independence than in virginia
* Rice was the staple crop in Carolina, so planters wanted skilled slaves who knew the complex process of rice cultivation
